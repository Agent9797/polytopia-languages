# User-made translations for Polytopia

## How to use custom translation?

You can find links to all available translations [here](https://polytopia.netlify.com/).

In Polytopia, open settings, select "Custom..." language and paste the url to the language file.

## How to contribute?

There are couple ways to contribute, you can make a pull request, open an issue to improve existing translation or, if you're not a programmer, you can sand me your translation via issue or private message on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/kap89).

## Pull requests

1. Fork the repo

2. Get the original language file from here: http://midjiwan.com/lang/en_US.json

3. Add your translation to the `translations` folder, named `<LANG_SHORTCUT>.json`.

4. Optionally you can add the `author` field to your JSON file.

5. Make a pull request - if everything is ok it will be merged and automatically deployed on [polytopia.netlify.com](https://polytopia.netlify.com/).
